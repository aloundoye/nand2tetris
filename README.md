# nand2tetris
nand2tetris is a project-centered course<br><br>
In this project-centered course we build a modern computer system, from the ground up. 
Weâ€™ll divide this fascinating journey into twelve hands-on projects that will take us from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer in the firt part.<br> 
In the second part, we build a modern software hierarchy, designed to enable the translation and execution of object-based, high-level languages on a bare-bone computer hardware platform. In particular, we implement a virtual machine and a compiler for a simple, Java-like programming language, and we develop a basic operating system that closes gaps between the high-level language and the underlying hardware platform. In the process, we will gain a deep, hands-on understanding of numerous topics in applied computer science, e.g. stack processing, parsing, code generation, and classical algorithms and data structures for memory management, vector graphics, input-output handling, and various other topics that lie at the very core of every modern computer system.
